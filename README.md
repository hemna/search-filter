This project is a simple search html page that allows you to add your own site filters
for google search results.  You can edit the site list, then hit search.  Search
will send you to google.com and automatically add the site filters to the result.

This is so you can remove the annoying paywalled siters from the search results
such as geeksforgeeks.com and quora.com
